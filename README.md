###Gameplay
Player with the less trump card begin game. If the attack succeeds, the defender loses his or her turn and the attack passes to the player on the defender's left. If the attack fails, the defender becomes the next attacker. Nobody, besides attacker, can attack defender. If defender loses his turn nobody can give him more cards. 
The last person with cards left in his or her hand is the loser.
